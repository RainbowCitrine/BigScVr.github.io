          On September 8th 2022, was the first day that marked our virtual
          reality journey for our group. Our first reality we visited was known
          as bigscreen vr. I will say it was a very unique application, since we
          were able to watch movies, YouTube, and clips on a big screen anywhere
          we went. We were able to venture to unique places like Mars, space,
          fancy apartments, huge theaters, and many more. Each place produced an
          incredible big screen, like the one you would see at your local movie
          theater and in each room we were able to use fun tools that the app
          provided us whether it digital soda, popcorn, markers, and a selfie
          stick.

          When I first started my researching if virtual reality can impact the
          educational system I was very skeptical of the matter. However, I have
          to say this assignment left me impressed with how well it went. I
          found myself bond with my teammates much more in this world than I did
          in a normal classroom setting. I got the feeling that no one had
          wanted to leave the world despite so much time passing by. There was
          also this sense of comfort that I can’t really explain, almost like a
          bond you get when you know your friend group for so long. However, I
          had only met my teammates about a few weeks ago and to make such a
          discovery was intriguing. I feel as though it is because we were able
          to go places that we are not able to in the real world which gave us
          this sense of adventure, as we explored so many of the worlds. This
          fact mixed with throwing tomatoes at one another, drawing on many of
          the walls, and taking selfies was most likely the reasoning as to why
          there was such a bond in our presence. Our favorite place we traveled
          to had to be the fancy balcony. This is because we tasted what it was
          like to hangout in a very expensive house with an amazing view. It
          felt as though we were rich and enjoying a film on a balcony with an
          amazing view. Although, one matter that I still find super interesting
          was that even though we had known each other in real life we never
          actually talked about anything regarding the real world. Everything we
          spoke about had to do with the world we were in and quite frankly we
          spoke a lot, so seeing how this played out was quite interesting. I
          will most likely continue to evaluate this and see if we ever stop and
          do speak about our lives in the real world while being in vr.

          As I am writing this journal I want to raise this question. Has my
          opinion about vr’s potential to impact our education system been
          swayed? In all honesty I am not totally sure. There is still so much
          to discover alongside my group. I think I will continue to wait on
          this question, however my teammates did say in their journals that
          they had a similar experience to mine, so I feel I will find the
          answer to this question soon.
